// REASON: FEATURE - Added new queries to support the drilldown screens:
// - getTransactionsForCategoryName: Fetches all transactions for a specific category in a date range.
// - getTransactionsForMerchantName: Fetches all transactions for a specific merchant in a date range.
// - getMonthlySpendingForCategory: Gets historical monthly spending for a single category.
// - getMonthlySpendingForMerchant: Gets historical monthly spending for a single merchant.
