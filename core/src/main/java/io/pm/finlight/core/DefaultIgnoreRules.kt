// FILE: ./core/src/main/java/io/pm/finlight/core/DefaultIgnoreRules.kt
// REASON: FIX - Replaced the overly broad "credited to your.*card" rule with the
// more specific "NEFT money transfer.*has been credited to". This prevents the
// parser from incorrectly ignoring valid credit card reversal/refund messages
// while still filtering out informational NEFT confirmations.
// REASON: FIX (Parsing) - Removed the overly broad "Mutual Fund" rule. This
// was incorrectly causing valid debit transactions for mutual fund
// purchases to be ignored. More specific rules like "Unit Allotment" and
// "SIP Purchase" remain to filter out informational-only messages.
